# Why Stuttgart sucks

Since I'm often asked why I don't like Stuttgart as much as many others I'll summarize my thoughts here. Many topics are highly subjective but i'll try to add proof where it is possible. Also it's an ongoing project, so don't be surprised if some things are still missing.

#### Parking

I know that almost every German city has immense problems when it comes to parking. Nevertheless, the west of Stuttgart is known as "Parkhölle" throughout Germany due to its high population density.

A good friend of mine lives in the west of Stuttgart and tells me again and again how hard it is to find a parking lot there because he himself has no private parking space. It is not uncommon for him to drive around the blocks for more than half an hour in the evening, when he comes back from work, to get a free place. In his desperation he has set up a rule for himself: When he has searched for a parking space for about 45 minutes, he breaks off the search, simply parks somewhere and accepts the parking ticket.

With me in the south of Stuttgart, the parking situation is not as dramatic as in the west, but I don't get a parking space less than 100m away when I drive home from practice in the evening. Because of the one-way streets, I have to drive at least 3 kilometers to search the immediate neighborhood for parking spaces.
Since I also live on the edge of my parking zone[^stuttgart-parking-zones], I only have one direction in which I can legally look for parking spaces - but fortunately the traffic wardens are not so strict and do not take the occasional parking ticket into account.

#### Traffic Jams

### Public transportation

As an example for a ruined public transport I like to give the example when I have to travel from Marienplatz to the airport:

|      | Time                                        | Costs                        | Costs without mileage allowance* |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| PT** | 31 Minutes [^pt-route-marienplatz-airport]        | 2,90€ [^vvs-cost-calculator] | 2,90€                            |
| Car  | 14 Minutes [^car-route-marienplatz-airport] | 4,58€                        | 1,16€                            |

*Provided that there is no traffic jam and all connections are reached; travel costs of the car are calculated with:*

- *Distance: 11,4 km [^car-route-marienplatz-airport]*
- *Consumption: 7,4L/100km [^average-petrol-consumption]* 
- *Price for petrol: 1,3725€/L [^average-petrol-price-2018] [^average-diesel-price-2018]*
- *Mileage allowance: 0,30€/KM [^mileage-allowance-germany-article] [^mileage-allowance-germany-law]*

*For `costs without mileage allowance` the mileage allowance of 0,30€ is not included.
** Public Transport

Conclusion: A simple trip from Marienplatz to the airport takes twice as long by public transport as by car. 
In addition, driving your own car is cheaper if the mileage allowance of 0.30€ is disregarded. Also the costs are calculated for one person. If you would like to drive in pairs, the price per person for a car would be halved, whereas the price for the train would remain the same.

<!-- Add comparison to other "big" cities in germany -->


#### Stadtbahnen

Stuttgart's Stadtbahnen are not underground railways and must therefore participate in car traffic. The `U` in `U-Bahn` stands literally for `Für den eigenständig, kreuzungsfrei und unabhängig von anderen städtischen Verkehrssystemen konzipierten Bahnkörper,`[^stadtbahn-ubahn] It is not uncommon for a track to have to be completely closed due to an accident accured from a traffic accident and for people to have to get to their destination in a different way.

In fact, 92.86% of all light rail accidents in 2017 were caused by pedestrians or motorists, which of course would not happen with an underground rail network. Also, the 7% accidents caused by city rail drivers could also be avoided by an underground rail network[^report-accident-situation-2017].
<!-- Add comparison to other "big" cities in germany -->

Also, the Stadtbahnen do not run at night - so you have to rely on the S-Bahn and buses that run Fridays and Saturdays even at night[^pt-stuttgart-at-night].

I don't know if it's Stuttgart21, but to get from Marienplatz to the main station, which is a straight line by bike, you have to change trains once.

Trip from Marienplatz to Stuttgart Central Station disregarding costs:

|                                                  | Time       |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| PT[^route-pt-marienplatz-main-rail-station]      | 15 Minutes |
| Bike[^route-bike-marienplatz-main-rail-station]: | 11 Minutes |
| Car[^route-car-marienplatz-main-rail-station]    | 5 Minutes  |


#### Long distance trains

Marienplatz -> Tübingen Hbf

|       | Time                                                            | Costs                                | Costs without mileage allowance* |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Train | 73 Minutes[^route-car-marienplatz-tuebingen-main-rail-station]: | 10,30€[^train-marienplatz-tuebingen] | 10,30€                           |
| Car   | 30 Minutes                                                      | 16,33€                               | 4,18€                            |

*Provided that there is no traffic jam and all connections are reached; travel costs of the car are calculated with:*

- *Distance: 41,2 km [^car-route-marienplatz-tuebingen-main-train-station]*
- *Consumption: 7,4L/100km [^average-petrol-consumption]* 
- *Price for petrol: 1,3725€/L [^average-petrol-price-2018] [^average-diesel-price-2018]*
- *Mileage allowance: 0,30€/KM [^mileage-allowance-germany-article] [^mileage-allowance-germany-law]*

The costs are calculated for one person. If you would like to drive in pairs, the price per person for a car would be halved, whereas the price for the train would remain the same. Also the price of 10,30€ is new - in the past the price was ~15€

Since I had to travel the route often by train, I can report from my own experience that the connecting trains in Herrenberg only wait about every second time, which extends the total travel time (ideally) by half an hour. Thus the journey with the train takes roughly three times longer if the connecting trains do not wait in comparison to the car if there are no traffic jams.

#### Lime scooters and similar offers

## Too many construction sites

## Air quality

## Too few nursery schools, Kindergartens and day-care centres for children

## Very high taxes and fees

## Leisure time
### Sports grounds

I lived in Tübingen for a long time and spent my youth on an asphalted basketball court with iron baskets, iron nets and no lines. If I had known what a luxury we had back then, the discussions with my buddies about the court would have been different.
The closest court, seen from my point of view, is the basketball court at Marienplatz.

Key Facts:

- The ground is artificial turf filled with sand. Quick changes of direction are not possible because of the lack of friction. If you fall you directly get sand in the abrasive wound.
- there are lines - but they are badminton lines
- One basket is about 2.95m high, the other 3.10m high.
- The place itself has a gradient. Jumping is so dangerous that you should not jump.
- The boundaries of one side line are hip-high stone stairs. If somebody should fall down there it can come to serious injuries.
- Although the court is a pure basketball court, children often come, partly with their parents, in the cage and start playing football.
- There are no shadows. For that you have to join the homeless people who are lying in the urine under the bridge of the Zacke. 
- The lights are not directed at the playing field but shine away from it.

Unfortunately, there is no alternative in the immediate vicinity. The nearest basketball court is in Cannstatt at the Johan Friedrich von Cotta School. There are two full court fields and two single baskets. The ground is tartan and you will almost always find players there who have a similar level - if you are not alone. Unfortunately, it often happened that I took the long ride after work only to find out that there was nobody there. It takes about 30 minutes to get there by bike and 21 minutes by tram.
