# Why Stuttgart sucks

Since I'm often asked why I don't like Stuttgart as much as many others I'll summarize my thoughts here. Many topics are highly subjective but i'll try to add proof where it is possible. Also it's an ongoing project, so don't be surprised if some things are still missing.

## Parking

I know that almost every German city has immense problems when it comes to parking. Nevertheless, the west of Stuttgart is known as "Parkhölle" throughout Germany due to its high population density.

A good friend of mine lives in the west of Stuttgart and tells me again and again how hard it is to find a parking lot there because he himself has no private parking space. It is not uncommon for him to drive around the blocks for more than half an hour in the evening, when he comes back from work, to get a free place. In his desperation he has set up a rule for himself: When he has searched for a parking space for about 45 minutes, he breaks off the search, simply parks somewhere and accepts the parking ticket.

With me in the south of Stuttgart, the parking situation is not as dramatic as in the west, but I don't get a parking space less than 100m away when I drive home from training in the evening. Because of the one-way streets, I have to drive at least 3 kilometers to search the immediate neighborhood for parking spaces.
Since I also live on the edge of my parking zone, I only have one direction in which I can legally look for parking spaces - but fortunately the traffic wardens are not so strict and do not take the occasional parking ticket into account.


## ÖPNV

As an example for a ruined public transport I like to give the example when I have to travel from Marienplatz to the airport:

|      | Time       | Costs | Costs without mileage allowance* |
| ---- | ---------- | ----- | -------------------------------- |
| PT** | 40 Minutes | 2,90€ | 2,90€                            |
| Car  | 14 Minutes | 4,88€ | 1,28€                            |

*Provided that there is no traffic jam and all connections are reached; travel costs of the car are calculated with:*

- *Distance: 12 km*
- *Consumption: 7,9L/100km* 
- *Price for petrol: 1,35€/L*
- *Mileage allowance: 0,30€/KM*

*For `costs without mileage allowance` the mileage allowance of 0,30€ is not included.
** Public Transport

Conclusion: A simple trip from Marienplatz to the airport takes three times as long by public transport as by car. 
In addition, driving your own car is cheaper if the mileage allowance of 0.30€ is disregarded.

<!-- Add comparison to other "big" cities in germany -->


### Stadtbahnen

Stuttgart's Stadtbahnen are not underground railways and must therefore participate in car traffic. It is not uncommon for a track to have to be completely closed due to an accident and for people to have to get to their destination in a different way.

Also, the Stadtbahnen do not run at night - so you have to rely on the S-Bahn and buses that run from Thursday to Saturday even at night.

I don't know if it's Stuttgart21, but to get from Marienplatz to the main station, which is a straight line by bike, you have to change trains once.

Trip from Marienplatz to Stuttgart Central Station disregarding costs:

|      | Time       |
| ---- | ---------- |
| PT   | 16 Minutes |
| Bike | 11 Minutes |
| Car  | 5 Minutes  |


### Long distance trains

Marienplatz -> Tübingen Hbf

|       | Time       | Costs | Costs without mileage allowance* |
| ----- | ---------- | ----- | -------------------------------- |
| Train | 76 Minutes | 15€   | 15€                              |
| Car   | 30 Minutes | 16€   | 3,80€                            |

*Provided that there is no traffic jam and all connections are reached; travel costs of the car are calculated with:*

- *Distance: 40,5 km*
- *Consumption: 7,9L/100km* 
- *Price for petrol: 1,35€/L*
- *Mileage allowance: 0,30€/KM*

The costs are calculated for one person. If you would like to drive in pairs, the price per person for a car would be halved, whereas the price for the train would remain the same.

Since I had to travel the route often by train, I can report from my own experience that the connecting trains in Herrenberg only wait every second time, which extends the total travel time (ideally) by half an hour. Thus the journey with the train takes four times as long if the connecting trains do not wait in comparison to the car if there are no traffic jams.
